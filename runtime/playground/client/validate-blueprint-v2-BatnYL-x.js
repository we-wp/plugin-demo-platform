                description: `Parameters to pass to the plugin during activation.

These options are stored in a site option that the plugin can access during its activation hook. The option name is:

\`\`\`php 'blueprint_activation_' . plugin_basename( __FILE__ ) \`\`\`

This ensures uniqueness even when multiple versions of the same plugin exist. This is similar to how the \`register_activation_hook\` function requires the plugin file path as its first argument.

The Blueprint runner will remove the option after activating the plugin.

Example:

In the Blueprint: \`\`\`json {     "source": "woocommerce",     "activationOptions": {         "storeCity": "Wrocław",         "storeCountry": "Poland",         "storePostalCode": "53-607"     } } \`\`\`

In the plugin's activation hook:

\`\`\`php register_activation_hook( __FILE__, function( $network_wide ) {     // Get the activation options from the transient     $option_name = 'blueprint_activation_' . plugin_basename( __FILE__ );     $blueprint_activation_options = get_option( $option_name ) ?? [];

    if ( $blueprint_activation_options ) {         $store_city = $blueprint_activation_options['storeCity'] ?? '';         $store_country = $blueprint_activation_options['storeCountry'] ?? '';         $store_postal_code = $blueprint_activation_options['storePostalCode'] ?? '';

        // ...do something with the options...     }

    // Continue with normal activation... } ); \`\`\``

Core features include 'title', 'editor', 'comments', 'revisions', 'trackbacks', 'author', 'excerpt', 'page-attributes', 'thumbnail', 'custom-fields', and 'post-formats'.

Additionally, the 'revisions' feature dictates whether the post type will store revisions, the 'autosave' feature dictates whether the post type will be autosaved, and the 'comments' feature dictates whether the comments count will show on the edit screen.

For backward compatibility reasons, adding 'editor' support implies 'autosave' support too.

A feature can also be specified as an array of arguments to provide additional information about supporting that feature.

Example: array( 'my_feature', array( 'field' => 'value' ) ).

If false, no features will be added. Default is an array containing 'title' and 'editor'.`

These options are stored in a site option that the plugin can access during its activation hook. The option name is:

\`\`\`php 'blueprint_activation_' . plugin_basename( __FILE__ ) \`\`\`

This ensures uniqueness even when multiple versions of the same plugin exist. This is similar to how the \`register_activation_hook\` function requires the plugin file path as its first argument.

The Blueprint runner will remove the option after activating the plugin.

Example:

In the Blueprint: \`\`\`json {     "source": "woocommerce",     "activationOptions": {         "storeCity": "Wrocław",         "storeCountry": "Poland",         "storePostalCode": "53-607"     } } \`\`\`

In the plugin's activation hook:

\`\`\`php register_activation_hook( __FILE__, function( $network_wide ) {     // Get the activation options from the transient     $option_name = 'blueprint_activation_' . plugin_basename( __FILE__ );     $blueprint_activation_options = get_option( $option_name ) ?? [];

    if ( $blueprint_activation_options ) {         $store_city = $blueprint_activation_options['storeCity'] ?? '';         $store_country = $blueprint_activation_options['storeCountry'] ?? '';         $store_postal_code = $blueprint_activation_options['storePostalCode'] ?? '';

        // ...do something with the options...     }

    // Continue with normal activation... } ); \`\`\``
